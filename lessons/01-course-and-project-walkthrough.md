- Key features and functionality we'll implement
- Technologies and tools we'll use throughout the project

## Notes

Welcome to the Next.js Fundamentals course! In this course, we'll cover the foundations of Next.js. It's assumed you have experience building with React, as we won't be diving into the details of React or its new features. If you need a refresher, check out Brian Holt's React course. This course focuses on Next.js, covering everything except the most advanced topics.

We'll be building a Linear clone, a product management app, together throughout the course. All the code will be available in the course notes, and each lesson has its own branch that you can checkout to see the solution. I'll introduce a topic or concept, demonstrate it with code, and then you can join me as we apply it to our app.
