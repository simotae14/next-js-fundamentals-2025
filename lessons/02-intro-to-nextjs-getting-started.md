# Introduction to Next.js: Getting Started

## What is Next.js

Next.js is a React-based framework for building hybrid applications. It enables you to create anything from static websites to fully dynamic web apps at scaleâ€”or any combination of the two. Built and maintained by Vercel, Next.js comes packed with a set of simple, opinionated conventions designed to streamline development and make sophisticated React features easier to adopt.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started: Setting up your Development Environment

Let's get your development environment ready! Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Install Node.js 20+:**

   - Ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed. You can check your version by running `node -v` in your terminal.
   - If you need to install or upgrade Node.js, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Replace `[repo]` with the actual repository URL provided for this lesson.
     ```bash
     git clone [repo]
     cd [your-repo-name]
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Navigate into the cloned repository directory in your terminal.
   - Install project dependencies using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     or the shorthand:
     ```bash
     npm i
     ```

4. **Checkout the Starting Branch:**

   - For this lesson, we'll start with the code from lesson 3. Checkout to the `03` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout 03
     ```
     This branch contains the starting point for this lesson's exercises.

5. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Look at the `.env.example` file in the project root. This file provides a template for the environment variables your application needs.
   - Create a new file named `.env` in the project root.
   - Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
   - **JWT Secret:** For `JWT_SECRET`, you can use any random string for development purposes. This secret is used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens.
   - **Database URL:** You'll need a PostgreSQL database.
     - **Option 1: Local PostgreSQL:** If you have PostgreSQL running locally, configure `DATABASE_URL` to connect to your local database.
     - **Option 2: Hosted PostgreSQL (Instagres/NeonDB):** For a quick setup, you can use [Instagres](https://www.instagres.com/) (powered by NeonDB) to get a temporary hosted PostgreSQL database.
       - Go to [Instagres](https://www.instagres.com/) and create a new database.
       - Copy the provided database URL.
       - Paste this URL as the value for `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file.
       - **Important:** Instagres databases expire after one hour. You can create a new one when needed or consider creating a free Neon account for a more persistent database.

6. **Run Database Migrations:**

   - To set up the database schema, you need to run database migrations. This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```
     This command uses Dirzzle ORM to push your database schema to the configured database.

7. **Start Development Server (Optional):**
   - While not strictly necessary for setup, you can start the development server to verify everything is working:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

ðŸŽ‰ **You're all set!** You've successfully set up your Next.js development environment and are ready to start exploring the code in lesson 3.
